# HaxRaspi RaspiClient

This is the Raspberry client component of HaxRaspi project. This client application is developed using Python 3.

HaxRaspi is a pentesting tool designed to assist when testing physical access to a site.
Client component of the project is installed on Raspberry Pi or similar device and connected to a 3G/LTE modem and to local area network or for example to a PC when visiting the site.

Raspberry sends interface related information such as IP and the connection state to the server component that can then be read using mobile client of the project.

In future features like conducting scans, running commands and running attacks over USB are possible to start using the mobile client.
